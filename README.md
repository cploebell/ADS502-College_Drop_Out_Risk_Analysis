## Project Intro/Objective 
The main purpose of this project is to identify students at risk of dropping out from higher education institutions by leveraging predictive analytics. By analyzing key features such as academic performance, gender, financial status, and socio-demographic factors, this project aims to provide actionable insights to educators and administrators. Early identification of at-risk students allows for timely interventions, such as tailored academic support, counseling, or financial aid, to improve retention rates.
</p>
The potential impact of this project includes fostering student success, reducing institutional dropout rates, and promoting equity in education by addressing challenges faced by vulnerable student populations. This application can help institutions optimize resources, enhance academic outcomes, and support the long-term success of their students.

#### Questions and Hypotheses
Key Questions: </p>
• What are the primary factors contributing to student dropout rates? </p>
• Can we accurately predict which students are at risk of dropping out? </p>
Hypotheses: </p>
• Academic performance (e.g., low GPA) is a strong predictor of dropout likelihood. </p>
#### Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modeling
Data Cleaning: Reviewed missing values, outliers, and normalized numerical features. </p>
Exploratory Data Analysis: Used visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) to explore relationships and distributions.  </p>
Predictive Modeling: Applied machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests for dropout prediction. </p>
#### Challenges
Feature Selection: The dataset had a sigificiant number of features, so determining which features had the most predictive power required processing. </p>
Data Limitations: The dataset represents only a specific institution or subset of students, which introduces sampling constraints and limits the ability to generalize findings to other populations or educational systems. It also only includes information known at the time of student enrollment and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters.
